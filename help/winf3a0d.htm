<P>File Manager is a tool you can use to organize your files and directories. You can use File Manager to move and copy files, start applications, connect to network drives, print documents, and maintain disks. </P>

<P>In File Manager, your files and directories are displayed in a directory window. The directory window is split: the left half displays the directory tree, and the right half displays the contents of the current directory. When you select a different directory in the directory tree, the contents of that directory are displayed in the right half of the window. </P>

<P>In the directory window, each filename has an icon next to it, indicating what kind of file it is. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Directories. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm7.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Shared directories. These are directories users can connect to on the network. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm2.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Program files, PIFs, and batch files. These files start applications. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm3.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Document files. These files are associated with applications. When you choose a document file, the application starts and opens the file. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm4.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> System or hidden files. These files have system or hidden attributes. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm5.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> All other files. </P>

<P>In the top left corner of each directory window are icons for each drive you currently have access to. These icons are called drive icons. Different icons represent the different types of drives on your computer: hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, network drives, RAM drives, and CD-ROM drives. You can change to a different drive by selecting its drive icon. </P>
