<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm6.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>From the Window menu, choose Cascade to arrange windows so that they overlap (starting in the upper-left corner of the File Manager workspace) and the title bar of each window remains visible. </P>

<P>Or choose Tile Horizontally from the Window menu to arrange windows on top of each other so that they do not overlap. </P>

<P>Or choose Tile Vertically to arrange the directory windows side by side so that they do not overlap. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="./images/bm6.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>From the Window menu, choose Arrange Icons. Note that this option affects only the minimized directory window icons. (For example if you have minimized windows and have moved their icons around this option will re-arrange them in a neat row.) </P>
