<P>If you have applications that support object linking and embedding, you can use File Manager to insert a file into another file. Some applications can accept documents (client applications), whereas others can only supply documents (server applications). Documents can be embedded or linked only into client applications. You can embed a file from any application; however, you can only link a file from a server application. </P>

<P>When you use File Manager to embed or link a file, an icon representing the file (called a package) is embedded into the destination file. </P>

<P><B>To embed a file into another file</B></P>
